Statistics: Linear Models

This course covers the fundamentals of linear models in statistics, starting with the simple linear model (least squares) and then introducing the broader framework that includes logistic regression among other topics.

Throughout the course, we will delve into estimation and hypothesis testing in these models.

Finally, we will explore the challenges of variable selection within this context, primarily focusing on L1 regularization/penalization (Lasso) and greedy selection methods.
